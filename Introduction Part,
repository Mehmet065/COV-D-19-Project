The whole world has been trying to fight Covid-19, an epidemic disease, for about 2 years.
This extraordinary situation, which many people were caught unprepared for, has caused a radical change in our lifestyles and working conditions.
As a result, other factors most affected by this situation were our education and working conditions.
Education and training channels have developed hybrid education forms and online exam platforms within the framework of various measures.
Digital education platforms were in high demand. Students became able to access all kinds of information through a computer and internet connection, but this also started to cause problems in the field of applied education.
Students who are graduates of the years 2020-2021, who have great difficulties in finding internships and beginner-level jobs, have started to look for many ways to find jobs in different fields.
At the same time, existing employees had to be fired, found another job or changed their current working conditions.
Governments and companies alike are applying for layoffs in some jobs, but have difficulty finding experienced staff to work in some areas.
